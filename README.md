<h5 align="center">Fast, Stable, and most importantly Low Detections!</h5>

<h3 align="center">Setup</h3>
Lithium Builder is one of the first python malware builders, meaning you can create your own malware and deploy it with ease. There are a few local dependencies which will need to be installed. 
1. First off install a version of python 3.75 or above. 
2. Make sure that python is added to path, once added to path run the following commands:

```
  pip install pyqt5
  pip install requests
  pip install pyinstaller
```

This will install all requirements for Lithium Builder to function.

<h3 align="center">Usage</h3>
Once you have setup finished run the file called LithiumBuilder.pyw, you will be greated with a slick pyqt5 user interface.

The current settings consist of:
```
Chrome - Grabs victim's Discord token from Google Chrome
Discord - Grabs victim's Discord token from the Discord client
Base64 - Encodes the webhook using base64
UserData - Grabs victim's IP address and computer username.
```
there is also an update button which I properly integrated for the devs looking to use a decent builder base. 

<h3 align="center">Demo</h3>
Once you have built your first client which will be located in the dist folder you can run it to make sure its working. You will be sent a list of data depending on your build settings.
